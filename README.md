# Pre-ignition app

To develop an on-line ‘investment readiness’ self assessment tool (‘PI app) which delivers significant value to targeted agri entrepreneurs as well as to the Agribusiness Booster program.

## Agri-entrepreneurs
The PI app will enable early stage agri entrepreneurs within the AbB target area to self assess their level of ‘investment readiness’.  Over time, the PI app can become a 
valuable on-line learning tool as well as a way for agri entrepreneurs to connect with peers and other relevant stakeholders such as investors.

## AbB program
The PI app will enable a large amount of relevant information to be collected from a wide range of targeted agri businesses in an organized and effective manner.  The data is analyzed and visualized within the app giving relevant insights to assist with decision making, especially around the entrepreneur selection process.  This drives cost efficiency in the selection process and allows for data driven decision making and program design.  The PI app can be developed to track the performance of businesses over time making it a valuable M&E/ impact assessment tool.  There are also options to deepen the verification process of the information (e.g. self-assessed, partly verified, fully verified).
